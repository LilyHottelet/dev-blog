As a self-taught game programmer, I love learning about new technologies and discover new practices. This is an ever-evolving section.

## Overview
When it comes to side projects, I would say that divide my time between three aspects : first is reading technical books and articles,then following online classes and programs and finally make things of my own. As a fresh graduate, I started this process during my studies and have tried my best to keep it up as I transition into a full time job.


## Fun Projects
* Based on what I have learned about web design during my studies, I have made this website. I built it using Jekyll and created my own css theme for it. My aim is to add a blog section to talk about dev topics.

* I also created a prototype website for my graduate work using jekyll and sass.

* I wrote an essay about communication between departments in video game studios and whether or not hybrid profiles (like technical designer) facilitate that communication.

* During my studies, I have made an sushi-bar game using flash and ActionScript 3. It was my first experience coding for a game and it was loads of fun.


## Books I have enjoyed reading
Below is a list of books I have read in the past two years that have particularly stuck with me. They are filled with valuable lessons that I often think about when I work. I occasionally refer back to them when I am in doubt about certain practices. I genuinely believe that they have helped me gain some invaluable insights into what makes code or design "professional".

* [***The Art of Game Design***](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Game-Design-Book-Lenses/dp/0123694965) **by Jesse Schell** 

## Online Learning Programs I have enjoyed
Online classes are the way I first learned to program for games, so I like to try and keep active on at least one during my free time. This allows me to challenge myself to new things, but also helps me to maintain some language agnostic skills.

* [***Unreal Engine C++ Developer class***](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/) **by Ben Tristem**
