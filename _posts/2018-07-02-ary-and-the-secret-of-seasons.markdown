{:.summary}
Ary and the Secret of Seasons is an award-winning 3D puzzle adventure game. In this indie title, the player takes control of the seasons and uses them to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and discover the beautiful world of Valdi.
The game is the result of a collaboration between two Belgian studios, eXiin and Fishing Cactus, and is published by Modus Games.


## Overview
I joined the project as an intern and then got hired to keep working on the game. As a programmer I have been able to 
contribute to the existing code base, but I also took on some design and management related tasks. Because I am a firm believer in team communication and structure, I took extra care of these aspects in my work. This involved leading and partaking in studio meetings, sometimes assigning and keeping track of tasks, as well as working in close collaboration with artists, designers and writers. 

## Technologies
*Unity 3D, C#, Visual Studio, Git using SourceTree, Photoshop.*

## My contributions to the project

### Tooling
* **Message Dev Tool** : A bug reporting tool allowing developers accross all teams to post issues to git directly from the game, using the existing slingshot mechanic.
* **Quest Editor Tool** : A custom quest editor created to facilitate the creation and edit of quest assets. It was designed to be like a "recipe creator" for quests.
* **Dialogue Editor Tool** : A custom dialogue editor with a nodal interface, designed to offer a clear view of an interaction. Created to offer writers more flexibility and to integrate really easily with localization and the quest system.

### UI Design and Integration
* **Designed a new look for the UI** : Creation of mockups with updated style guidelines.
* **Menu Integration** : Implemented the new quest and dialogue related windows as well as menus, using Unity UI.
* **Notification System** : Designed and implemented various notifications styles to relay quest information to the player.

### Gameplay Systems
* **Quest system** : Designed and implemented from scratch a flexible system with a "designer-friendly" front-end. The system is designed to handle both the main story line and the side quest content and also serves as a base for the hint system. 
* **Dialogue system** : Also designed from scratch with a user friendly front-end. The system is designed to co-exist with the quest system, using it to give context to conversations and NPC interactions, allowing for a lively world experience.
* **Story-related Sub-systems** : I also implemented some smaller scale systems such as a diary page collection system, a reputation/reward system and other small tasks.
