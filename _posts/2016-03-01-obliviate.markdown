Obliviate is a project I directed for a VFX class. Our concept was to make a teaser for our dream video game : a Harry Potter themed VR experience.

## Overview
For this project, I took on the role of director and was responsible for the management of our VFX artist team, as well as a small camera crew. Because I had experience with both computer graphics and camera work, I felt I could really understand the constraints of the project and plan the work efficiently. The project is not public but can be viewed here.


## Writing process
The challenge of student projects is always to scope the work adequately, since the resources are limited. For this particular assignment, we also had to come up with creative ways to incorporate both real and virtual environments. Here's how I approached the work in my director role : 

* I organized regular meetings with the VFX team to try and identify what themes would really inspire us. We brainstormed many possible stories, but decided to explore fan-fiction. The format of a teaser helped us define certain codes and guided our choices down the line.

* Because we chose the format of a teaser, I first wrote a narrating voice structure to define what we wanted to convey.What makes this a Harry Potter themed short while remaining original work ? We opted to give our interpretation of a sequel. We went on to storyboarding and concepts. 

* When we locked the story, we recorded the narrator's voice with a British actor. We built and sourced props and we also casted our actors.

## Execution

* When the time came to film, I directed the team by giving instructions for each shot, based on documents I had previously prepared. I also gave directions for the actors. 

* When the rushes came back, we started work on the VFX. I personally spent my time on the "video game" parts of the teaser by desiging the different screens and interfaces. 

* I also oversaw the picture editing with our team as well as the sound editing with a couple of sound engineers.

Overall, I would say that my role was to make sure the style and intentions were consistent throughout the whole process.
