Homicide : The Fallen Idol is an investigation style game prototype. When a movie star is found dead at the Whitmore Hotel gala, Inspector McCoy is on the case, snooping around for information.

## Overview
My graduate work is the reason why I went into game development in the first place. At the time I was completing a bachelor in multi-media and specialising in web development. My love of story telling and story-driven content brought me to the idea of developing a game. That’s when I got interested in Unity. Little by little I learned the ropes of C# programming for games, I assembled a team of artists and we started working on this project in the hopes of creating an investigation style game, set in the 1940’s. 

## Technologies
*Unity 3D, C#, Rider, Ink, Photoshop, Adobe Premiere.*

## My contributions to the project
For this project, I was the only programmer. But I was also a beginner, trying to teach myself C# code while developing the systems for the game. A big part of my work consisted in writing story and make sure it translated into all the aspects of the game.

### Story Writing
Because it was a student project and it was a first game experience, we weren't always confident in our ability to deliver the story with our limited resources. The game concept was always investigation, but the plot and style went through many iterations. In the end, we got inspired by the *noire* genre and went with a *"LA Noire"* inspired prototype.

* **Research** : We knew the story had to translate into the writing as well as the environments so we decided that our research should include many different mediums. I read non-fiction books about how to write for the investigation genre, as well as many fiction books to get a feel for the narrative style. Once we were set on a decade for our story, we heavily researched the time period using antique collection catalogs, newspaper of the time and all sorts of art, architecture and history books. Because we were trying to recreate a lavish hotel lobby, I even organized a small trip to a hotel of the era still in activity so the artists could really get a feel for scale and atmosphere. Little by little, we managed to really define what we wanted the player to feel.

* **Writing Process** : I first used *Twine* then moved to *Ink* paired with the *Inky* software and *Unity* to first create a loose structure of the plot. When we were comfortable with what we could achieve in developement, we settled on some key elements, but we always kept the door open on some details. I also used *Ink* to write all the dialogues, allowing myself one level of branching. We locked down the story when we recorded the lines for all actors.

* **Voice Acting** : I wrote indications for all the lines and sent it off to the actors overseas. After receiving the audio tracks, I edited it all into lines and integrated it in the game.

* **Game Trailer** : I oversaw the editing of the trailer of the game [which can be found here](https://youtu.be/3W0X8m_bzIo).


### Project Management
This type of project was very much a first for our school and we had to present a strong planning in order to convince the teachers that we would be able to deliver something. I took charge of the project management and made sure we were staying on track over the course of the assignment.

* **Agile Practices** : Although we didn't adopt a full agile practice, I introduced the daily meeting, some variation of the sprint planning as well as regular reviews and check-ins. This allowed us to re-evaluate our deadlines often and prevent frustration in the team. 

* **Task Planning** : I kept track of a long-term as well as short-term planning for each person and area of developement. This served as a strong base for setting expectations, both for us and our teachers.

* **Communication** : Communication inside the team was important, but a big part of my role in management was to communicate about the project and the project's need to other people. 

### Programming
As the only programmer in the team, I made the code for the whole game while learning on the job. Some interesting systems I got to create were : 

* **Dialogue and Scenario Tools** : I wrote the dialogues myself using *Ink* which integrates easily in *Unity*. I also developed an editor tool to create scenarios for rapid prototyping, which allowed me to test different plot structures.

* **Interaction System** : I wrote a flexible interaction system that could easily be extended to support more interaction types. Even if I did most of the setup work, I tried to focus on offering a "designer-friendly" solution to easily place more interactions and scenario elements in the scene. 

* **UI Integration** : I designed and integrated all of the UI, in a classic investigative style.
