Hello Internet world, this is my first ever blog entry ! 

My name is Alix (but my friends and family call me Lily) and I am a programmer from Belgium. At the time of this writing, I have worked in the video game industry for just under a year. 

If there is something I keep hearing about, it's the importance of continuous learning in a developer's career (or any career, one might argue).
