Algobot is a puzzle solving edutainment game developed by Fishing Cactus, an independent Belgian studio. 
I had the opportunity to work on the project for 7 weeks, in the context of a programming internship. 
It was my very first professional experience in the video game industry and at the time the studio actually took a chance on me because I had no prior education in game development or C# programming. I self taught game enthusiast with a web development background. 

For this reason, I would say the tasks I was assigned reflected the level of experience I had then.  
During those short 7 weeks I leaned about coding standards and basic git flow through version control and code reviews. As I got more familiar with the project, I also learned about design patterns and how some of them were implemented in the project. I learned a lot more about the Unity Engine and its editor through UI integration. I worked on the implementation of in-game menus as well as some level editor features. 

Last but not least, my experience working on Algobot taught me a lot about what itâ€™s like to work in a team environment and to communicate with different departments, which I think is a valuable skill.
