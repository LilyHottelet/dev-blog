My graduate work is the reason why I went into game development in the first place. At the time I was completing a bachelor in multi-media and specialising in web development. My love of story telling and story-driven content brought me to the idea of developing a game. That’s when I got interested in Unity. Little by little I learned the ropes of C# programming for games, I assembled a team of artists and we started working on this project in the hopes of creating an investigation style game, set in the 1940’s. 

We worked on it on and off for about a year and a half, combining it with our classes and other assignments. 
I was in charge of all the programming myself but, as it often happens with student projects, I also took on the roles of project manager or game designer from time to time. 

As one would expect I made many mistakes working . In fact, the project barely made it as a demo. 
From underestimating scope to getting lost in never-ending refactors and failing to reach out for the advice of senior devs. The team went through all of the pitfalls of a first-ever game project. 

I still made every single system from scratch, including a basic story manager, a dynamic scene loading system and some point&click style interactions. 

It all sounds pretty negative, but given some perspective, I am glad we made those mistakes. This whole experience taught me to fail and to keep going. But more importantly; it still set a strong base for my developer career.
