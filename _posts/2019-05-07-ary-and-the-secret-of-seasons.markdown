Ary and the Secret of Seasons is a 3D puzzle adventure game where the player bends the seasons to his will in order to solve puzzles and affect his environment. The game is developed by a small Belgian studio and published by Modus Games.

I have joined the studio of eXiin just under a year ago, when I was given the chance to do/perform/ my internship there.  Soon after, I was hired to continue working on the project after my school graduation. I have been working there as a full time programmer ever since.During these past few months, I have had the opportunity to perform a wide variety of tasks, which sometimes allowed me to experiment outside of my comfort zone. This continuous learning experience has helped tremendously with figuring out what I enjoy the most about my job. As I go, I find that it also allows me to identify my strengths, while still working on improving my weaknesses.

Here’s a small overview of what I have contributed to the project.

## Tooling 

The main task of my summer internship was to create a bug reporting tool that could be used by different members of the team in various locations, in editor and in build. The main goal of the tool was to use the existing slingshot mechanic to leave some 3D messages in the world, and to upload these messages to github on the fly. By sending all these notes to our github repository, we would ensure that the feedback was centralised. The user also had the option to automatically snap and upload a screenshot of the problem to the repo.

Working on this tool allowed me to dive into the github REST API and Web Requests from Unity. 

Multiple versions of the tool were made, with a fast iteration loop. I have learned a lot from listening to the end user’s needs and trying to implement features accordingly. 

## AI development 

Later on, I was trusted to participate in some more complex systems. For a while, I worked to integrate some new enemy designs into an existing AI base system. I found this to be challenging because it forced me to fit my work into the conventions of an existing system. I also helped with refactoring parts of the system, which was a true lesson in design.

## UI Design and Integration

At some point during the project, the UI needed some refactor, both from a code and visual standpoint. While a colleague performed a major refactor of the UI,  I found myself creating new UI assets and integrating them into the new system. This experience felt validating to me because I was I able to take advantage of my polyvalent background to do both graphic design and programming at the same time. This allowed me to iterate much faster as well : I kept in mind the technical limitations when I designed the UI, and I was aware of what kind of assets I would deal with when I implemented the code. This made for a very satisfying experience.

## Gameplay Systems

Most recently, I have been able to take responsibility for another larger gameplay system : Quest and Dialogue Management. This task allowed my to create my own system from the ground up.I started on paper and, after reviewing the system requirements, I was able to challenge my design and push it further.  I really enjoyed this whole process. Even if, to a certain degree, the system keeps evolving to accommodate new features, the final design was achieved by asking for opinions to senior developers but also drawing from my own experience designing story-driven gameplay.This type of task also allows me to be in close communication with artists and designers, which I really enjoy. I personally feel that doing programming work at the very frontier of game design is what I have enjoyed most so far.

I have about four months remaining on the project before I move on to a new chapter in my career. During that time, I hope to both finish my assigned tasks and provide the rest of the team with a clear documentation and overview of what I contributed in the project to facilitate the transition. I found that working with this transition in mind has also made me think twice about what I write, and how it appears to other devs. I know our little Ary will do very well out there when she’s ready to be published :)
