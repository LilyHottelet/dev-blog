{:.summary}
Ary and the Secret of Seasons is an award-winning 3D puzzle adventure game. In this indie title, the player takes control of the seasons and uses them to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and discover the beautiful world of Valdi.
The game is the result of a collaboration between two belgian studios, eXiin and Fishing Cactus, and is published by Modus Games.


## Overview
I joined the project as an intern and then got hired to keep working on the game. As a programmer I have been able to contribute to the existing code base, but my focus progressively shifted to include more design, story writing and management tasks. Being responsible for writing all the story related systems allowed me to get a strong understanding of how story should be built for this game. This led me to effectively take on the role of quest designer.
 

## Technologies
*Unity 3D, C#, Visual Studio, Git using SourceTree, Photoshop*

## My contributions to the project

### Quest Design
* **Story Review** : In collaboration with different writers, I helped review the story of the game as a whole. I strived to adress every uncertainty or possible weakness in the plot while making sure the story changes didn't impact the production or the gameplay in a negative way. The goal is always to provide the player with the best possible experience.
* **Design Documents** : I was responsible for designing the side quest content, sometimes in collaboration with other designers, sometimes individually. For each quest proposal that made it through the approval process, I created documents to detail the resources needed from each department. These served as a reference for level designers and writers and allowed the different people involved to quickly get to the information they needed. I also created other broader documents with the help of other designers to offer more of a macro approach and make sure the story and game feel were consistent throughout the game.
* **Dialogue Writing** : In collaboration with writers, I worked to shape the dialogue for all of the side quest content, using my own tools.
* **Programming Systems And Tools** : I designed and wrote all of the systems that relate to quests and dialogues, putting the emphasis on usability. I went the extra mile to make my tools flexible, intuitive and really approachable for designers without programming knowledge. I also provided documentation for all of my systems and tools.
* **In-Game Integration** : I integrated a large portion of the side quest content in the game but also taught other designers to use the system so that they could implement content of their own. 
  
### UI Design and Integration
* **Designed a new look for the UI** : Creation of mockups with updated style guidelines to give the UI a new look and feel.
* **Menu Integration** : Implemented the new quest and dialogue related windows as well as menus, using Unity UI.
* **Notification System** : Designed and implemented various notifications styles to relay quest information to the player.

### Game presentations
I have been presenting the game in various settings, in English and in French. At events like E3 or Gamescom, I have been able to speak to the press as well as potential investors and social media influencers about what makes the game unique and worthwhile. I also played and commented press demos in real time.
