Algobot is a puzzle solving edutainment game developed by Fishing Cactus, an indie belgian studio. 
In this title, the player uses algorithms to command Algo Bot, a service droid, and help PAL, a cantankerous line manager, to contain the crisis. 

## Overview
I had the opportunity to work on the project for 7 weeks, in the context of a programming internship. 
It was my very first professional experience in the video game industry, after a few months of being self-taught.
For this reason, I would say the tasks I was assigned reflected the level of experience I had back then.  

## Technologies
*Unity 3D, C#, Visual Studio, Git with Babun*

## My Contributions to the project

* **UI integration** : I integrated some of the menus and navigation with localization.
* **Gameplay** : I implemented new mechanics into the existing code base, following the original design.
* **Dialogue System** : I wrote the very beginning of the dialogue system, with a basic implementation.
* **Editor Tools** : I added small features into an existing level editor.
