Algobot is a puzzle solving edutainment game developed by Fishing Cactus, an indie belgian studio. 
In this title, the player uses algorithms to command Algo Bot, a service droid, and help PAL, a cantankerous line manager, to contain the crisis. 

## Overview
I had the opportunity to work on the project for 7 weeks, in the context of a programming internship. 
It was my very first professional experience in the video game industry, after a few months of being self-taught.
For this reason, I would say the tasks I was assigned reflected the level of experience I had back then.  

## Technologies
*Unity 3D, C#, Visual Studio, Git with Babun*

## My Contributions to the project

* **Story Meetings** : I participated in team meetings about the story of the game. Because it was a short internship, I didn't have the opportunity to create a big impact. But it taught me a lot about the possibilities and limitations of working with an external writer. The challenge for this title was to give the puzzles and characters enough context to engage the player without shadowing the gameplay.
* **UI integration** : I integrated some of the menus and navigation with localization.
* **Gameplay** : I implemented new mechanics into the existing code base, following the original design.
* **Dialogue System** : I wrote the very beginning of the dialogue system, with a basic implementation.
* **Editor Tools** : I added small features into an existing level editor.
